# general workflow

 input CSV file
     1-1-1 is a simple representation
     ocldb... is the actual shape of the original files.

# parse CSV file
     pull lat/long information, date/time information, and temp/salinity/DO information

# store CSV file in either a matrix or database record?
   currently being parsed into a matrix for simplicity
   will probably generate a DB table to store information once shape has been validated

once the above workflow functions, add recursion
